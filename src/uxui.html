    <p>UI is the User Interface design and UX is the User Experience design. Both are crucial to user satisfaction in different ways.</p>
    <p>UI is about the visual elements and interactivity of the website; it is about making the webpage look pretty.</p>
    <p>UX, on the other hand, is about making the user's experience as frictionless as possible; it is about doing research in order to make using the website easier to use and more understandable to users.</p>
